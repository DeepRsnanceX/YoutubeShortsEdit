# v1.0.1
- Added a Keybind to trigger the effect manually if desired (Enable Manual Triggering via Settings first!).
- Hopefully fixed issues with file names/paths containing special characters.
- Fixed vignette & edit image still being visible after Level Complete sometimes (Toggleable, off by default. Cuz it's pretty funny honestly).

# v1.0.0
- Chad Initial Release. :moyai:
