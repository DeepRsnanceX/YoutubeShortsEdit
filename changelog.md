# v1.0.1
- Added a Keybind to trigger the effect manually instead of randomly on click/release if desired (Enable Manual Triggering via Settings first! defaults to V, change in Custom Keybinds menu).
- Added a setting alongside this to enable a button to manually trigger the effect (For accessibility for mobile users).
- Hopefully fixed issues with file names/paths containing special characters.
- Added a fix for vignette & edit image still being visible after Level Complete sometimes (Toggleable, off by default. Cuz it's pretty funny honestly).

# v1.0.0
- Chad Initial Release. :moyai:
