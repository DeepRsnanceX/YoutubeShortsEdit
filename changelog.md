# v1.0.1
- <cg>Added</c><cy>Manual Trigger!</c> - The mod now has a setting (off by default) to disable the mod's Randomness and instead toggle the Phonk Edit Effect whenever you want to!! Enable "<cl>Trigger Manually</c>" in the mod's settings to enable Manual Trigger! The mod defaults to the "V" key to activate the effect, although this is configurable via geode's Custom Keybinds mod.
- <cg>Added</c><cy>Manual Button!</c> - An accessibility feature for Mobile users who can't use a keybind which shows a button in the UI to toggle the effect manually! Acts the same as the keybind, but as a button.
- (Hopefully) fixed issues with file names/paths containing special characters.
- Added a fix for vignette & edit images still being visible after Level Complete sometimes (Toggleable, <cl>off by default.</c> Cuz it's pretty funny honestly).
- (Hopefully) Fixed an issue where dying once would make the edit effect never happen again in that run.
- Fixed being able to restart or enter/exit practice mode via some shortcuts while an edit is happening.

# v1.0.0
